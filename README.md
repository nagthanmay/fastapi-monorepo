# FastAPI Monorepo Template

## Overview

This is a scalable, production-ready FastAPI monorepo setup following modern software engineering practices. It includes:

- Monorepo structure with `apps/` and `libs/`
- PostgreSQL integration
- Alembic migrations
- Linting, type checking, pre-commit hooks
- JSON logging, request tracing, health checks
- API versioning, autogenerated docs

---

## Project Structure

- `apps/`: FastAPI applications
- `libs/`: Shared utilities like environment loaders
- `core/`: Config, logging, middleware, version tracking
- `db/`: ORM models, sessions, migrations
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

---

##  Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd fastapi-monorepo


##Code Skeleton 

Main App Logic

    main.py: Initializes FastAPI app, adds middleware, routers, exception handlers.

    health.py: Sample /v1/health endpoint.
    db_check.py: Optional /v1/db-check to verify DB connectivity.

Middleware

    middleware.py: Custom middleware for:

    Adding unique request IDs

    Tracking request duration

    Returning backend Git version

Environment Handling

    config.py: Loads and validates environment variables using Pydantic.

    env_loader.py: Utility used by config.py to read .env file.

Logging

    logging.py: Pretty logs in development and structured JSON logs in production.

Version Tracking

    version.py: Extracts Git commit SHA for traceability.

Exception Handling

    exceptions.py: Catches and returns formatted errors for HTTP and validation issues.

Database Integration

    base.py: Defines the SQLAlchemy base class.

    session.py: Sets up DB engine and sessionmaker.

    migrations/: Folder to store Alembic migration scripts.

    models/user.py: Defines User table model

    migrations/: Alembic folder for DB migrations

Testing

    test_health.py: Verifies health endpoint returns 200 OK.

Core Features 

    1.Deterministic dependency management using requirements.txt

    2.Dev/prod logging

    3.Middleware for trace IDs, request timing, and version headers

    4.Environment validation with .env

    5.Code quality: black, ruff, mypy, pre-commit hooks

    6.Centralized exception handling

    7.Versioned FastAPI routing with Swagger tags

    8.PostgreSQL integration with SQLAlchemy + Alembic

    9.Unit and integration test support

    10.GitHub Actions CI pipeline

Philosophy

Why Monorepo?

    Organizes multiple apps in apps/ and shared libraries in libs/

    Promotes modularity, reuse, and scalability

Developer Productivity

    Out-of-the-box features like versioning, logging, tracing, API docs, and env loading

    CI/CD and testing pre-integrated

Maintainability & Scalability

    Clear separation of concerns

    Configurable with modern tools

    Easy to scale into microservices

Instructions on How to RUN

Step1: clone the Repo
git clone <https://github.com/nagthanmay/fastapi-monorepo.git>
cd fastapi-monorepo

Step2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # For windows

step3: install python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

step4: 
Environment Variables
Create a .env file:

ENVIRONMENT=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/app_db
APP_NAME=main_api

Step 5: Run Database Migrations (if any)
If you have Alembic configured with migrations:
alembic upgrade head
Otherwise, ensure your tables are created using SQLAlchemy models.

Step 6: Run the FastAPI App

uvicorn apps.main_api.main:app --reload
You should see output like:
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Step 7: Access FastAPI Swagger Docs
Open your browser and navigate to:
Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs

ReDoc UI: http://localhost:8000/redoc

These UIs are auto-generated by FastAPI from your route definitions and Pydantic schemas.

Troubleshooting Tips
If you see ModuleNotFoundError, make sure your folder structure matches the monorepo layout.

If your DB isnâ€™t connecting, verify the DATABASE_URL and that your PostgreSQL server is running.

For errors on .env, confirm it is located at the root and named correctly.
